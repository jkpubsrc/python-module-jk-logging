Formatting Log Messages
=======================

Whenever log messages are written to file or to the console a log message formatter is used. Such a formatter take the log message data record and creates a (formatted) text representation from this log record.

Log formatters are used within all kinds of classes that create textual output, especially loggers such as `ConsoleLogger` and `FileLogger`.
